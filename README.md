This repository contains a Perl program demonstrating an array index out-of-bounds error and its solution. The bug.pl file shows the error, while bugSolution.pl provides a corrected version that handles the potential error gracefully using error checking.  The error occurs when attempting to access an element beyond the existing array bounds, which can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes. The solution introduces better error handling techniques.
